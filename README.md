- callbacks
- closures
- equality
- objects
- promise
- prototypes

## Data Structures

Teach existing JavaScript data structures such as arrays, sets, and maps. Also teach how to implement other common data
 structures/algorithms such as stacks, linked lists, trees, graphs, etc...

- arrays
  - joining multiple arrays
  - iterator functions
  - es6 array features
  - sorting
  - searching
  - displaying as string
- stacks
- queue
- priority queue
- linked list
- sets
- dictionaries
- hash tables
- map
- weakmap & weakset
- trees
- graphs
- sorting algorithms
- searching algorithms
- recursion
- greedy algorithms
- big o / algorithm complexity

## ES6 Features

Overview of all the new features, syntax, and changes in ES6.

- let
- arrow functions
- template literals
- spread operator
- classes
- inheritance
- generators

***

## Using ES6

To enable ES6 support in any JetBrains IDE *(such as WebStorm)*:
- File > Settings > Languages & Frameworks > JavaScript
- Select EMCAScript 6

If your editor doesn't have ES6 support, you can follow along by creating a new pen at https://codepen.io/ and enabling
"Babel" as the JavaScript Preprocessor.
