## Using ES6

To enable ES6 support in any JetBrains IDE *(such as WebStorm)*:
- File > Settings > Languages & Frameworks > JavaScript
- Select EMCAScript 6

If your editor doesn't have ES6 support, you can follow along by creating a new pen at https://codepen.io/ and enabling
"Babel" as the JavaScript Preprocessor.
