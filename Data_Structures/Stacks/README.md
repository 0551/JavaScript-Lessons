# Stacks

A stack is a basic data structure that can be logically thought as linear structure represented by a real physical
stack or pile, a structure where insertion and deletion of items takes place at one end called top of the stack. The
basic concept can be illustrated by thinking of your data set as a stack of plates or books where you can only take the
top item off the stack in order to remove things from it.
